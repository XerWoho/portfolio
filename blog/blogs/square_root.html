            SQUARE ROOT

        <p class="main_description">
            Whether it is in school, or in programming, taking the square root of a number is not a rarity. But, how does this simple, yet widely used algorithm work? What is behind this "√" character?

            Introduction
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            What is taking the square root of a number? Basically, the calculation; 
            <br>
            y = √x
            <br>
            <br>
            can be written as;
            <br>
            y = x * x
            <br>
            <br>
            In which, you try to find what value for x can be added, to get the value y.
            Now, there are a lof of reasons to do this, but the biggest usage of the square root is during complicated mathmatical
            compilations in programming. Whether it is 2D or 3D rendering, most of the time, the square root comes into play, where
            it is used a lot.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other than that, it also plays a crucial role in our life. 
            <br>
            You can find the usage of square roots in finances, statistics,
            geometry, physics, engineering or data analysis. Basically, everything that revolves around numbers, is bound to need 
            a square root number.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            So, from where did we get this awesome formula though? Well, we gotta go back a lot.
            In the old times, the Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek Mathmaticians. Even they used
            square roots in their time.
            <br>
            The tactics used for determining the square root of a number vary a lot though, as 
            there is always more than just one way of finding out how something works.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, what we will be focusing on, is the Babylonian method, because it is the most
            elegant method from all of them (This is not an opinion, it is a fact, deal with it.).
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="title">
                Formula
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Babylonian's had a good idea in mind, when trying to decide what would be a good
                algorithm, to determine the square root.
                <br>
                As mentioned prior, basically, taking the square root of a number looks like this;
                <br>
                y = x*x
                <br>
                <br>
                And, you can also write that in a different way;
                <br>
                y / x = x
                <br>
                <br>
                so, basically, the square root of a number, is the number, divided by the square root itself (duh.).
                So, a logical formula, would be this;
                <br>
                xn+1 = (xn + (a/xn)) / 2
                <br>
                <br>
                If you guys didnt get it yet, this is in fact, a recursive function. Lets take it step by step.
                <br>
                The value for "xn", is an initial guess value. In there, you can guess any number you want, doesnt matter.
                I personally take a (the number we want the root of), and divide it by two, for my first guess, but it doesnt really matter.
                <br>
                <br>

                    Usage
                </p>
                <p>
                Lets say, our a is 19. We want the square root of that. This is how the function would look;
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 1. <br>
                xn = 19 / 2 = 9.5
                <br>
                xn+1 = (9.5 + (19 / 9.5)) / 2
                <br>
                xn+1 = 5.75
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 2. <br>
                xn+1 = (5.75 + (19 / 5.75)) / 2
                <br>
                xn+1 = 4.527173913
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 3. <br>
                xn+1 = (4.53 + (19 / 4.53)) / 2
                <br>
                xn+1 = 4.3621302428

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                That is a weird number, but what is the square root of 19 anyway? <br>
                Well, the square root is 4.3588989435, which is pretty damn close if you ask me.
                This method, is not a finite method. You can repeat the recursion, to any extent. Until
                you get the identical value. Meaning, until xn equals xn+1. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Its as simple as that. This is a quick and easy way to approximate the square root of a number,
                by simply "running" this recursion three times. But, if we were gonna programm this, how would
                it look like?
