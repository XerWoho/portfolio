Hi,

my name is XerWo, a guy who likes to create and build stuff, whilst banging his head on his keyboard because of an error 
that could've been fixed with a simple semi-colon.

Probably sounds familiar to a lot of software developers, but that is basically what I do. Creating random CLIs, building
stuff from scratch, or coding fullstack web apps, that will probably never see the day of light, just because of boredom.
I do that, on simple programming languages such as Python, JavaScript and Zig.

Programming is a big part of my life, kinda something I do when I have nothing else to do. If the refrigerator is still empty
after opening it for the 6th time, I just head to VSCode and do whatever. Been doing that since I was 13, and well, I will
probably be doing it till the end of time.
 
Started programming at the age of 13 (as already mentioned), but with fairly dull discord bot scripts, and CTRL+C CTRL+V 
as my favourite keyboard shortcuts. It is true, that it is not good practice to copy everything without learning, but I 
really had no idea about anything back then, I was just doing what I thought was right. Finally after months of coding, I started
going to an online course where I learned a bunch of new stuff, about how to think like a coder.

Due to the fact, that the course kinda was underwhelming, I quit it, and focused on improving myself on my own.

Which is where I am right now. 17 year old, and still nothing (kinda).
